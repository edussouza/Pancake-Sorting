<h1 align="center">Pancake Sorting</h1>

<p align="center">Pancake sorting is the mathematical problem of sorting a disordered stack of pancakes in order of size when a spatula can be inserted at any point in the stack and used to flip all pancakes above it.</p>
<p align="center">Code written in C language by PUCSP's students and it solves the Pancake Sorting using two functions to put the numbers in order and one function that creates a disordered Stack. </p>
